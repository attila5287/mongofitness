a full stack node-js app that tracks fitness exercises gym routines, and similar sports activities by user. NPM: ExpressJS framework for server, MongoDB database ORM mongoose 
# Unit 17 NoSQL Homework: Workout Tracker

## User Story
```
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
```

## Acceptance Criteria
When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

- [ ] -  Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

- [ ] -  UPDATE // Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

- [ ] -  View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

- [ ] -  View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

> **Important:** Look into using a MongoDB aggregate function to dynamically add up and return the total duration for each workout. Check out the [MongoDB documentation on the $addFields](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/addFields/), the [MongoDB documentation on the $sum operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sum/), and the [Mongoose documentation on aggregate functions](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#aggregate_Aggregate) to learn how it can be accomplished.
